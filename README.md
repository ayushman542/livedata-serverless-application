User Information Fetcher
This project aims to fetch user details based on a search query from a third-party API. It leverages various technologies and methodologies to ensure efficient and reliable data retrieval.

Technologies Used
Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for handling asynchronous operations such as API requests.

AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is used to handle the backend logic in a cost-effective and scalable manner.

API Gateway
API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs. It serves as the entry point for the Lambda function.

Axios
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for Node.js and the browser. It is used to make HTTP requests to the third-party API due to its simplicity and support for promises, making asynchronous operations easier to manage.

JavaScript (ES6+)
Modern JavaScript features such as async/await, destructuring, and template literals are used to write clean and readable code.

Amazon S3
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service. The project files are deployed to an S3 bucket, allowing for easy hosting and access.
